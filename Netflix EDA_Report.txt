# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Report for Netflix Titles Dataset

## 1. Data Overview

- The dataset contains 8807 entries and 12 columns. 
- Columns include `show_id`, `type`, `title`, `director`, `cast`, `country`, `date_added`, `release_year`, `rating`, `duration`, `listed_in`, and `description`.
- Missing values are present in `director` (2634), `cast` (825), `country` (831), `date_added` (10), and `rating` (4), and `duration` (3). These missing values will need to be handled depending on the specific analysis, but for EDA, they were noted.
- The `release_year` column is of integer type (int64), while all other relevant columns are of object type (strings).

## 2. Numerical Feature Distribution (release_year)

### Histogram Insights:
- **Distribution Shape**: Heavily skewed to the left (negatively skewed), indicating a higher number of titles released in more recent years.
- **Central Tendency**: Peak concentration of releases observed after 2010, with a significant surge in the late 2010s and early 2020s, suggesting increased content production/acquisition by Netflix.
- **Spread**: Release years range from the mid-20th century (e.g., 1942) up to 2021, but the vast majority of content is from the last two decades.
- **Outliers/Anomalies**: Older entries from before the year 2000 are present but are few compared to the newer releases, indicating a broad content library.

## 3. Categorical Feature Analysis

### type Distribution:
- **Dominant Category**: 'Movie' is overwhelmingly dominant, significantly outnumbering 'TV Show' entries. This implies Netflix's content strategy leans heavily towards movies.

### rating Distribution:
- **Most Frequent Ratings**: 'TV-MA', 'TV-14', and 'TV-PG' are most common, suggesting a strong focus on content for mature audiences or requiring parental discretion.
- **Family-Friendly Content**: Ratings like 'PG-13', 'R', 'PG', 'G', and 'TV-G' are present but less frequent.
- **Sparse Categories**: 'NC-17', 'NR', 'TV-Y7-FV', and 'TV-Y' are rare.
- **Implication**: The content library caters broadly but emphasizes content for teenagers and adults.

### Top 10 `director` Distribution:
- **Dominant Directors**: A few directors (e.g., Rajiv Mehra, Jan Suter, Raul Campos, Marcus Raboy) have directed a significantly larger number of titles, suggesting repeated collaborations or acquisitions from prolific creators.
- **Long Tail**: Most directors have very few contributions.

### Top 10 `cast` Distribution:
- **Frequent Actors**: A small group of actors (e.g., Anupam Kher, Shah Rukh Khan, Boman Irani) appear in many titles, possibly indicating regional preferences (e.g., Bollywood).

### Top 10 `country` Distribution:
- **United States Dominance**: The US is the most frequent country of production.
- **International Presence**: India and the UK are also significant contributors, showing Netflix's global reach.
- **Diverse Sources**: Despite dominance, many other countries are represented, indicating a diverse content library.

### Top 10 `date_added` Distribution:
- **Recent Content Focus**: A clear trend towards more recent additions, peaking around 2021, suggesting continuous and increasing content flow.

### Top 10 `duration` Distribution:
- **Movies**: Most movies are between 90-120 minutes.
- **TV Shows**: '1 Season' is overwhelmingly common, indicating many limited series or newly added shows.
- **Varied Lengths**: Content of various lengths is offered.

### Top 10 `listed_in` (Genres) Distribution:
- **Popular Genres**: 'Dramas', 'Comedies', 'International Movies', 'Documentaries', and 'Action & Adventure' are most frequent.
- **Multi-Genre Content**: Many titles fit multiple genres.
- **Content Strategy**: Prevalence of 'International Movies' and 'International TV Shows' aligns with global content acquisition.

## 4. Outlier Identification (release_year)

### Box Plot Insights:
- **Median and IQR**: The bulk of content is from the early 2000s to early 2020s.
- **Outliers**: Numerous data points extend below the lower whisker, representing titles released in much older years (e.g., mid-20th century). These are statistically identified as outliers but are not erroneous; they reflect Netflix's acquisition of historical content, showing the breadth of its library.

## 5. Correlation Heatmap

- **Not Applicable**: A correlation heatmap could not be generated as `release_year` is the only numerical feature in the dataset; at least two numerical variables are required to assess pairwise correlations.

## Summary of Main Discoveries:

1.  **Content Focus**: Netflix's library is heavily dominated by Movies, significantly more than TV Shows. A substantial portion of content is geared towards mature audiences (TV-MA, TV-14).
2.  **Recent Expansion**: There has been a significant and continuous increase in content additions in recent years, especially after 2010, with a peak around 2021.
3.  **Geographical Diversity with US Dominance**: While the US is the primary source of content, there's a strong international presence, notably from India and the UK, reflecting a global content strategy.
4.  **Prolific Creators**: A small number of directors and actors contribute to a disproportionately high number of titles, indicating strategic partnerships or acquisitions.
5.  **Genre Trends**: Dramas, Comedies, and International Movies are the most popular genres.
6.  **Outlier Significance**: 'Outliers' in `release_year` represent older, valid content, showcasing the historical depth of Netflix's offerings rather than data anomalies.

## 6. Important Features for Prediction

Based on the Exploratory Data Analysis, the following features are identified as potentially important for predictive modeling due to their significant distributions, patterns, or direct relevance to content characteristics:

1.  **type**: This feature directly categorizes content into 'Movie' or 'TV Show'. Its highly imbalanced distribution (Movies are dominant) makes it a crucial predictor for distinguishing content formats, which likely impacts viewing patterns, production budgets, and target audience. For example, predicting audience engagement might vary significantly between a movie and a TV show.

2.  **release_year**: The distribution of `release_year` showed a clear trend towards more recent content, with a surge in releases after 2010. This feature is vital for understanding content recency, platform growth over time, and potential content obsolescence. Newer content might correlate with higher promotion or viewership, while very old titles ('outliers') represent a niche category with different predictive behaviors.

3.  **rating**: Directly indicates the target audience and content suitability. The prevalence of 'TV-MA', 'TV-14', and 'TV-PG' suggests specific audience segments. This feature would be highly predictive for content recommendation systems, audience segmentation, and understanding content restrictions or parental guidance needs.

4.  **country**: The distribution highlighted the dominance of the United States, followed by India and the UK. This feature is crucial for predicting regional popularity, language preferences, and cultural relevance. Content origin often correlates with target markets and potential viewership, making it important for localization strategies.

5.  **listed_in** (Genres): This feature directly describes the thematic categories of the content. The most popular genres ('Dramas', 'Comedies', 'International Movies', 'Documentaries', 'Action & Adventure') are strong indicators of audience interest. It is essential for content recommendation engines, genre-based analysis, and understanding market trends in content creation.

6.  **duration**: For movies, the length (typically 90-120 minutes) can influence viewing decisions. For TV shows, the '1 Season' dominance is highly indicative of limited series or new shows. This feature can help predict viewing commitment, content format (short-form vs. long-form), and completion rates.
